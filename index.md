    <h2 class="text-center">How to Manage Writing 150-250 Words in 8-10 Minutes for UPSC Mains</h2>
    <p>
        Writing effectively within a short timeframe is a crucial skill for the UPSC Mains exam. Here are some key strategies to help you manage your time and ensure that your answers are comprehensive, yet concise:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding the Question:</strong> Spend the first 1-2 minutes understanding the demand of the question. Identify the keywords such as ‘critically analyze,’ ‘explain,’ or ‘discuss’ to understand the depth required.</li>
        <li><strong>Structure Your Answer:</strong> Use a clear structure: Introduction, Body, and Conclusion. Introduce the topic briefly, dive into key points in the body, and summarize with a concise conclusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Answer Writing:</strong> The key to writing faster is consistent practice. Daily answer writing for at least 1-2 questions is highly recommended. Participate in test series or mock exams to simulate real-time pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Short Sentences:</strong> Write short, impactful sentences. Avoid long, complex paragraphs. Keep your sentences simple and to the point to save time and space.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Your Writing:</strong> As you practice, use a stopwatch to time yourself. Try to finish writing in 8 minutes for a 150-250 word answer, so you have time to review and correct any mistakes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-center">
        Remember, regular writing practice under timed conditions will not only improve your speed but also your precision in answering questions effectively.

<!-- Health & Breaks Section -->
<section id="breaks-health" class="container detail-section">
    <h2 class="text-center">How to Take Frequent Breaks and Maintain Health During UPSC Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        Preparing for the UPSC is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires sustained effort over a long period, and maintaining your physical and mental health is vital. Here are some tips to manage your health and take effective breaks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Follow the 50/10 Rule:</strong> Study for 50 minutes and take a 10-minute break. This allows you to refresh your mind and maintain concentration for longer periods.</li>
        <li><strong>Move Around During Breaks:</strong> Use your break time to stretch, walk, or do light exercises. Physical activity can improve blood circulation, reduce fatigue, and sharpen your focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Diet:</strong> Eat nutrient-rich meals with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and proteins. Avoid excessive caffeine or junk food as it can cause energy crashes.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep is Non-Negotiable:</strong> Ensure you get 7-8 hours of sleep daily. Sleep deprivation can severely impair your concentration, memory, and productivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Mindfulness:</strong> Incorporate relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, yoga, or meditation to reduce stress. A calm mind is essential for productive study sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and a drop in focus levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-center">
        Balancing preparation with health practices will help you maintain long-term focus, avoid burnout, and be at your best on exam day.
